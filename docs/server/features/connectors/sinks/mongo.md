## Overview

The MongoDB sink pulls messages from a KurrentDB stream and stores them in a
collection. The records will be serialized into
[BSON](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/#std-term-BSON)
documents, so the data must be valid for BSON format. 

## Quickstart

You can create the MongoDB Sink connector as follows. Replace `id` with a unique connector name or ID:

```http
POST /connectors/{{id}}
Host: localhost:2113
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "settings": {
    "instanceTypeName": "mongo-db-sink",
    "connectionString": "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27020",
    "database": "my_database",
    "collection": "my_collection",
    "subscription:filter:scope": "stream",
    "subscription:filter:filterType": "streamId",
    "subscription:filter:expression": "example-stream"
  }
}
```

After creating and starting the MongoDB sink connector, every time an event is
appended to the `example-stream`, the MongoDB sink connector will send the
record to the specified collection in the database. You can find a list of
available management API endpoints in the [API Reference](../manage.md).

## Settings

Adjust these settings to specify the behavior and interaction of your MongoDB sink connector with KurrentDB, ensuring it operates according to your requirements and preferences.

::: tip
The MongoDB sink inherits a set of common settings that are used to configure the connector. The settings can be found in
the [Sink Options](../settings.md#sink-options) page.

The MongoDB sink can be configured with the following options:

Resilience options can be found in the [Resilience Configuration](../settings.md#resilience-configuration) section.

## Metadata

The MongoDB sink connector automatically includes these [default headers](../features.md#headers) in each document sent to the collection. These
headers provide metadata about the event and are stored in a `_metadata` field
within the document.

## Examples

### Authentication

This MongoDB sink connector currently only supports [SCRAM](./mongo.md#scram) and [X.509 certificate authentication](./mongo.md#x509-certificate-authentication).

#### SCRAM

To use SCRAM for authentication, include the username and password in the
connection string and set the `authMechanism` parameter in the connection string
to either `SCRAM-SHA-1` or `SCRAM-SHA-256` to select the desired MongoDB
authentication mechanism. For more explanations on the connection string URI
refer to the official MongoDB documentation on [Authentication Mechanism](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/core/authentication-mechanisms/#:~:text=To%20specify%20the%20authentication%20mechanism,mechanism%20from%20the%20command%20line.).

::: note
MongoDB version 4.0 and later uses SCRAM-SHA-256 as the default authentication mechanism if the MongoDB server version supports it.
:::

#### X.509 certificate authentication

To use X.509 certificate authentication, include the base64 encoded x509
certificate and the password in the settings. You can use an online tool like
[base64encode](https://www.base64encode.org/) to encode your certificate.

```http
POST /connectors/{{id}}
Host: localhost:2113
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "certificate:rawData": "base64encodedstring",
  "certificate:password": "password"
}
```

### Document ID Strategy

The id of the document can be generated automatically based on the source specified and expression if needed. The following options are available:

By default, the MongoDB sink connector uses the record's Id as the document ID. This is the unique identifier generated for every record in KurrentDB.

**Set Document ID using Stream ID**

You can extract part of the stream name using a regular expression (regex) to
define the document id. The expression is optional and can be customized based
on your naming convention. In this example, the expression captures the stream
name up to `_data`.

```http
POST /connectors/{{id}}
Host: localhost:2113
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "documentId:source": "stream",
  "documentId:expression": "^(.*)_data$"
}
```

Alternatively, if you only need the last segment of the stream name (after a
hyphen), you can use the `streamSuffix` source. This
doesn't require an expression since it automatically extracts the suffix.

```http
POST /connectors/{{id}}
Host: localhost:2113
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "documentId:source": "streamSuffix"
}
```

The `streamSuffix` source is useful when stream names follow a structured
format, and you want to use only the trailing part as the document ID. For
example, if the stream is named `user-123`, the document ID would be `123`.

**Set Document ID from Headers**

You can create the document ID by combining values from a record's metadata.

```http
POST /connectors/{{id}}
Host: localhost:2113
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "documentId:source": "headers",
  "documentId:expression": "key1,key2"
}
```
Specify the header keys you want to use in the `documentId:expression` field (e.g., `key1,key2`). The connector will concatenate the header values with a hyphen (`-`) to create the partition key.

For example, if your event has headers `key1: regionA` and `key2: zone1`, the partition key will be `regionA-zone1`.
